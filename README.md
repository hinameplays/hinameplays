## Welcome to my Profile!

I hope that you stick around for a while.

### About me

- 💻 I'm pretty solid in python, java and I can do some basic stuff with [websites](https://hinameplays.duckdns.org).
- 🔧 I’m yer big greasy guy, always in and around machines and old iron. I also like to make stuff do things it wasn't supposed to do.
- 🌈 My pronouns are he/him; as some may know from my website I consider myself open to anything.

Occupations: studying MechEng w/ SE GS, doing IT support; Hobbies: Gaming, Engineering, Cars, tacticool stuff

Programming and markup languages as is best practice:

- Python
- Java (+ Scala, C#, JS and other "similar" languages)
- asm (mainly 32/64) [and by extension c, I just never do projects in it because I don't like it]
- G-Code, the manual way

- Markdown
- LaTeX
- HTML (+CSS)

### Current projects

I own multiple old machine tools and try to get the best out of them. Currently I am also trying to achieve a specific output of 15kW/kg wet with a rotary engine.
I also do basic restorations, usually parts like cyl heads or other 30s-90s machinery.

Going fast is fun. Driving slow cars fast is especially fun. I am working on multiple old cars like a 1U Octavia w/ the 2l I4 AQY engine (now almost stock again). I daily a 3rd gen sedan with "minor" changes. I really like weird czech and jap cars for some reason.

Under [berlinkeys](https://github.com/berlinkeys) i am currently designing a custom 120% keyboard with a friend.
We ([@9hax.net](https://github.com/9hax)) will release it's ready.
