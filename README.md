### Current projects

I own multiple old machine tools and try to get the best out of them. Currently I am also trying to achieve a specific output of 15kW/kg wet with a rotary engine.
I also do basic restorations, usually parts like cyl heads or other 30s-90s machinery.

Going fast is fun. Driving slow cars hard is especially fun. I am working on multiple old cars like a 1U Octavia w/ the 2l I4 AQY engine (now almost stock again). I daily a 3rd gen sedan with minor changes. As you can tell, I am a Skoda fan, but I also do like the japanese stuff.

Under the name [berlinkeys](https://github.com/berlinkeys) i am currently designing a custom 120% keyboard with a friend.
We ([@9hax.net](https://github.com/9hax)) will release it when the first parts of design are done.
