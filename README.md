### Current projects

I own multiple old machine tools and try to get the best out of them. Currently I am trying to achieve a specific output of 15kW/kg wet with a rotary.
I also do basic restorations, usually bike parts like Simson cyl heads.

Going fast is fun. I am working on multiple old cars and personally own a 1U Octavia w/ the 2l I4 AAZ engine (chipped to about 180hp).

Under the name [berlinkeys](https://github.com/berllinkeys) i am currently designing a custom 120% keyboard which you can build yourself.
We ([@9hax.net](https://github.com/9hax)) will release it when the first parts of design are done.
